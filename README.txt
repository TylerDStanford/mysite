The purpose of this website is not only to serve as a practice ground for my HTML skills, but also to provide a platform that reflects who I am beyond a traditional résumé. While a résumé can only capture so much, I hope this site allows anyone—future employers and visitors alike—to learn more about me and easily get in touch.

If you have any questions about my site or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out. My contact information is available on the contact page.
