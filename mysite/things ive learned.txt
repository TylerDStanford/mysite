Basic layout:
	head
		
	Body
		contains most info, contains articles
			articles
				like "cards". Contain more concentrated information
	Footer
		just as sounds, usually for end statements like the date, my name, any last bit of info
Margin
-spacing around things like articles
	GAP is a better alternative isntead of figuring out the Margin values.

rem
-number system? each value is a number followed by"rem" like "1rem" = 1
